# Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling of Latent Traits

This project simulates a latent psychological trait (Î¸) and uses Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) to recover it from observed behaviors and predict downstream outcomes. The goal is to demonstrate how abstract cognitive profilesâ€”like holistic vs analytic thinkingâ€”can influence financial behavior under uncertainty.

## Concept

We simulate a population of agents, each with a latent trait score. This unobserved trait affects:
- Panic response
- Risk preference
- Volatility avoidance

These behavioral indicators are noisy but informative reflections of the underlying trait.

The latent trait also influences downstream financial outcomes:
- Net profit
- Reaction time
- Market exit timing

This structure mirrors real-world situations where hidden psychological variables shape both observed behavior and financial decisions.

## Modeling Approach

We use PyMC to:
- Define a Bayesian measurement model of the latent trait using three behavioral indicators
- Fit a structural model predicting three financial outcomes from the latent trait
- Sample from the full posterior using the NUTS algorithm

All data were simulated in advance and standardized.

## Results

The model recovers posterior distributions for:
- Trait loadings (`lambda_*`)
- Regression paths to outcomes (`beta_*`)

> This plot shows the 94% highest density intervals (HDIs) for how the latent trait Î¸ affects each outcome. Intervals that exclude zero suggest strong directional effects.
